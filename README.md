## Get the tree the right way round!!!
As it says on the piHut webside, use caution when installing the tree on the pi, or it could end badly for you pi.
The resisters should be facing into the board.

## Install guide
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

sudo apt-get install python3-gpiozero
```
